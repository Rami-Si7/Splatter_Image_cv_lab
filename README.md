# Splatter Image - Supervise by desired splatter image
In this project we aim to enhance the splatter image rendering by introducing a new loss function that incorporates supervision from a 'target' splatter image The new loss function is designed to improve learning by leveraging multi-view data and comparing reconstructions with the desired target image, thereby guiding the model towards better predictions.
